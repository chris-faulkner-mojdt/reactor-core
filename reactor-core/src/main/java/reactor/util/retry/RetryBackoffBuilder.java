/**
 * A builder for a retry strategy based on exponential backoffs, with fine grained options.
 * Retry delays are randomized with a user-provided {@link #jitter(double)} factor between {@code 0.d} (no jitter)
 * and {@code 1.0} (default is {@code 0.5}).
 * Even with the jitter, the effective backoff delay cannot be less than {@link #minBackoff(Duration)}
 * nor more than {@link #maxBackoff(Duration)}. The delays and subsequent attempts are executed on the
 * provided backoff {@link #scheduler(Scheduler)}.
 * <p>
 * Only errors that match the {@link #throwablePredicate(Predicate)} are retried (by default all),
 * and the number of attempts can also limited with {@link #maxAttempts(long)}.
 * When the maximum attempt of retries is reached, a runtime exception is propagated downstream which
 * can be pinpointed with {@link reactor.core.Exceptions#isRetryExhausted(Throwable)}. The cause of
 * the last attempt's failure is attached as said {@link reactor.core.Exceptions#retryExhausted(long, Throwable) retryExhausted}
 * exception's cause.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, to help dealing with bursts of transient errors in a long-lived Flux as if each burst
 * had its own backoff, one can choose to set {@link #transientErrors(boolean)} to {@code true}.
 * The comparison to {@link #maxAttempts(long)} will then be done with the number of subsequent attempts
 * that failed without an {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber#onNext(Object) onNext} in between.
 * <p>
 * The {@link RetryBackoffBuilder} is copy-on-write and as such can be stored as a "template" and further configured
 * by different components without a risk of modifying the original configuration.
